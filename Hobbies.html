<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Community involvement, writing, blogging, learning languages, photography, traveling, doing sports, reading, and art.
Listening to podcasts, audiobooks about all the most significant historical revolutions, how they ignited, what changes they made;
Traveling: probably the second most frequent hobby;
Cards game, just one, a weird and funny guy;
Martial arts;
Going out with family in the middle of nature;
Movies and series: so much love for Netflix;
Eating: I am Nigerian, so that can explain it, but many like to go to the restaurants, try new things;
Going to comedy shows;
Going to the bars, hanging out with friends in front of a beer pint.
